# kObjects.org

kObjects.org was created in the early 2000s by Stefan Haustein as a namepace umbrella for some MIDP-related projects, most notably kxml2. 

The original "idea" behind the name was "Kilobyte Objects", but now we are pivoting towards "Kotlin Objects".

## Projects

- [Konsole](http://github.com/kobjects/konsole): A chat-like KMP "console" interface.
- [kXml2](https://github.com/kobjects/kxml2): A lightweight "pull" parser for XML.
- [kXml3](https://github.com/kobjects/kxml3): Kxml2 ported to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
